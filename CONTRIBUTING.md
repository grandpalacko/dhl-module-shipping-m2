Contribution Guide
==================

We are happy to receive contributions to the DHL Shipping module for Magento® 2.

Bugs, change requests, and improvement suggestions can be reported:

* through the [DHL Support Portal](http://dhl.support.netresearch.de/), or
* by sending an email to <dhl.support@netresearch.de>, or
* by creating an Issue on [Github](https://github.com/netresearch/dhl-module-shipping-m2/).

Please note that Issues on Github are not intended for support requests (e.g.
integration, configuration, module usage). For such questions, please check
the [DHL Support Portal](http://dhl.support.netresearch.de/). Most known
problems and their solutions are documented there. You can also create a support
ticket there, if needed.

When reporting bugs, please include the following information with your description:

* PHP version 
* Magento® version
* Module version
* Log files, if applicable
* EKP (DHL account number)

A more elaborate contribution procedure (including GitHub issues and pull 
request workflows) will be established in the future.
